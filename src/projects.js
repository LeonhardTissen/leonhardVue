            <h3>Playable Characters</h3>
            I created the <a href="https://jollyworld.app/mod">character selection page</a> along with the character customization built on the modding system.
            Not only are players able to pick a wide variety of high quality community created characters, but they
            could create one themselves in seconds using a very performant in-browser image editor. Players that
            don't want to hand draw their characters could also pick from a wardrobe and have a fully personalized character
            in seconds that is ready to play right away.

            <h3>Level Editor Blueprints</h3>
            The Level Editor for JollyWorld can do pretty much anything, but this vast toolset can lead to an overwhelming
            feeling for a new level builder. This is why I extended the blueprint system, which allows for level builders
            to upload their creations in a beautiful, snappy layout. Building a level is a plug & play experience that is
            like no other.

            <h3>Level Design</h3>
            <a href="https://jollyworld.app/?user=Warze">I've also created my fair share of games</a> on the JollyWorld platform. They range from traditional stages to
            recreations of popular game titles such as Cat Mario and Bad Piggies. Many of my levels have more than 100,000 plays
            and one even stands at over 500,000 plays, which is the third most played level in the game.

            <h3>Level Design</h3>
            I built all 25 levels in the game. Jump from a friendly outdoor environment into a mighty lava-filled city or a
            dangerous factory. All the game elements are introduced in fair ways and used in all sorts of challenges.
            Designed with replayability in mind, players are challenged to get all 3 stars in the game that requires
            unveiling secrets and quick movement.

            <h3>Level Art</h3>
            I designed all of the tilesets in the game along with all of the game elements. Due to the fast paced gameplay,
            these needed to be cohesive and not throw you off. I also created some of the backgrounds.

        content: `
            The game was left without updates for many years, and with an established community that has brought some
            challenges. My goal was to improve the playing experience overall.

            <h3>Reimagined UI</h3>
            Nearly all of the UI elements have been redesigned to be more performant, adapting to different screen sizes
            and overall being more cohesive and understandable.

            <h3>Anti-Cheat</h3>
            Over time, more and more players have used cheats to break the game in various ways and one of my main goals
            was to prevent this. Nearly all cheats have been patched to allow for a fair playing field and a great experience
            for new players that are still learned the environment.

            <h3>Mobile Support</h3>
            I made the game playable on mobile devices and tablets by making all actions compatible with touch controls.
            This came with a lot of challenges but I managed to pull it off without adding any more UI clutter.

            <h3>Game Content</h3>
            A large portion of my contributions was ironing out existing world elements, but I even added my own resources
            and items, like the cactus and grappling hook.

            <h3>Unlimited Gameplay</h3>
            The game is designed to be endless but remain rewarding. There is always a new pet to discover.
            Prestiging allows for replayability without the game becoming mundane.

            <h3>Upgrade Islands</h3>
            Instead of getting your upgrades in a GUI, you have to walk to different islands.

            <h3>Mobile Support</h3>
            Unbox pets on the go with joystick controls.

            <h3>Performance</h3>
            The game was designed to handle hundreds of simultaneous pets with thousands of coins coming out of them.

        I was contacted to build a website for the rescue center who previously only had an online presence of social media
        accounts. The site compiles all the useful information about them in a pretty color scheme. I even made custom
        icons for their homepage.

        A place that simply lists out all my projects would be too boring. Instead I built my own operating system-like

        <a href="https://warze.org/wartos/customize">The desktop is even customizable</a>,
        from the background and colors all the way to the helper and window appearance.

        <h3>Social Experiment</h3>
        An ongoing social experiment inspired by r/place. Placing a pixel is completely anonymous and can be done every 5 seconds.

        <h3>Giant Canvas</h3>
        A 10000x10000 canvas brought a plethera of challenges. Pixels are stored in a custom format that loads incredibly quickly
        on any device to allow instantaneous placing of pixels. Due to the immense size, permaplace will never be fully filled,
        but that means there is always space for you.

        <h3>Collaboration</h3>
        Due to the time cooldown, you are incentivised to work together with friends. And that's exactly what people did.
        Giant creations were formed only made possible through teamwork and coordination, because remember:
        Any previously placed pixel can never be removed.

        <h3>Custom Rooms</h3>
        Users are able to create their own rooms with smaller canvas sizes and less restrictions.
